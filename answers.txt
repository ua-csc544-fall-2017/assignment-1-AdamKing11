1. I'm starting to work more and more with big data sets in my own research
	(linguistics) and I want to learn better ways to analyze and visualize the
	data, for presentations and my own ability to see patterns.

2. Brush up on some ML techniques and learn the best ways to graph data, considering
	the type of data/pattern/etc.

3. Python, Scala, R

4. Python

5. Only simple 2d line graphs in R (ggplot2)

6. Dealt with creating word embeddings for tokens in a 100 million tweet corpus. Used
 	word2vec implements in Python's gensim library.

7. A graph from a presentation at a conference. The graph showed response times and
	used color and spatial juxtaposition to really drive home difference between the
	two tested populations.

8. After browsing viz.wtf for 5 minutes, I've lost count....

9. Scala, R: Good enough to Google answers to most questions. Python: Good enough to
	understand the one snarky Stackoverflow commenter that answers the complex question
	with a single line of code.
	tl;dr - Scala, R - 40%, Python - 80%

10. Better than most linguists, not as good as most CS grads. 30%

11. Yes, used git a lot.

12. Spent the past year using it a lot.

13. Spent the past year using it a lot.

14. Spent the summer doing an NLP internship for a start-up that was building a 
	social media app that frontlines emojis. I'd probably talk about emojis 
	because I've been so inundated with them, not because I'm particularly
	interested in them....
